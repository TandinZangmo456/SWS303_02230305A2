# ASSIGNMENT 2 [INTERMEDIATE]  
## ELK STACK IMPLEMENTATION REPORT  

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  

This report documents the successful completion of Assignment 2 (Intermediate), focusing on advanced security analysis, automation, and performance optimization through three main tasks:

- **Task 3.1:** Generation of realistic security events to test monitoring  
- **Task 3.2:** Implementation of alerting mechanisms and correlation rules  
- **Task 3.3:** Performance analysis and optimization of the ELK stack  

All tasks have been successfully completed with comprehensive testing, analysis, and documentation. The implementation demonstrates effective security monitoring, threat detection capabilities, and optimal system performance.

### **Key Achievements**
- ✓ Generated **4 realistic attack scenarios** with **90+ new security events**  
- ✓ Designed **3 automated alerts** and implemented **3 correlation rules**  
- ✓ Identified **467+ coordinated attack events** across multiple log sources  
- ✓ Achieved **22–116ms query performance** (excellent)  
- ✓ Provided **6 detailed optimization recommendations**

## SECTION 4: CORRELATION RULE 1 — UFW + AUTH  

![alt text](<Screenshot from 2025-10-30 01-14-12.png>)

- **Total Hits:** 467 events  
- **Time Range:** Last 30 days  
- **Peak Activity:** Around Oct 6, 2025 (~500 events)  

**Effectiveness**
- ✓ 467 coordinated events identified  
- ✓ Multi-source correlation working correctly  
- ✓ High-volume persistent attack activity detected  

**Threat Assessment:** High Coordinated attacks detected across layers  

## SECTION 5: CORRELATION RULE 2 — SNORT + FIREWALL  

![alt text](<Screenshot from 2025-10-30 01-15-17.png>)

- **Total Hits:** 4 events  
- **Alerts:** Trojan, SSH Scan, Attack Response (Priority 1)  

**Effectiveness**
- ✓ 100% critical threat detection  
- ✓ Zero false positives  
- ✓ Complete attack chain: **Scan → Exploit → C&C**

**Threat Assessment:** **Critical — Active compromise attempts detected**

## SECTION 6: CORRELATION RULE 3 — SSH ATTACK CHAIN  

![alt text](<Screenshot from 2025-10-30 01-15-59.png>)

- **Total Hits:** 7 events  
- **Attack Phases:**
  1. Reconnaissance — SSH scan detected  
  2. Exploitation — Multiple failed SSH logins  
  3. Post-Exploitation — Privilege escalation via sudo  

**Effectiveness**
- ✓ Complete attack lifecycle captured  
- ✓ Cross-log correlation (Snort + Auth)  
- ✓ Attack persistence observed over multiple days  

**Threat Assessment:** **Sophisticated SSH kill chain detected**
